# Create JSON Update Prompt

Evaluate and improve the following project requirements:
Provide the improved requirements in the same JSON format as the input.
Produce only the JSON without any comments or additional text.
It is absolutely crucial that you generate a complete and perfect JSON without any omissions or abbreviations. Every field must be properly filled, and there should be no placeholder values or TODO comments.

It's absolutely critical that you conduct meticulous and comprehensive design for the backend, frontend, and database layers of this system. Half-assed, sloppy design work is completely unacceptable and will doom this project to failure.
You need to think through every detail and edge case for each component:
Backend: Robust API design, efficient algorithms, proper error handling, security measures, scalability considerations. Leave no stone unturned.
Frontend: Intuitive UX flow, responsive layouts, accessibility, performance optimization, state management. Make it bulletproof.
Database: Optimal schema design, indexing strategy, query optimization, data integrity rules, backup and recovery plans. Get it right the first time.

Project Description:
{project_description}

Current Requirements:
{current_requirements}

User Feedback:
{user_feedback}

Please analyze these requirements and make the following improvements:
1. Ensure there is a main file (e.g., main.py, index.js) in the appropriate location.
2. Check that all necessary dependencies are included.
3. Verify that the folder structure is logical and follows best practices for the chosen tech stack.
4. Make sure all function and method calls are correct and consistent.
5. Add any missing critical components for the project to function properly.
6. Ensure the tech stack is appropriate for the project description.
7. Verify that all features have clear and testable acceptance criteria.
8. Address all points mentioned in the user feedback.
9. If the user feedback introduces new features or major changes, integrate them seamlessly into the existing structure.
10. If the user feedback is vague or unclear, make reasonable assumptions and incorporate them into the requirements.
