Enhance the file descriptions in the generated JSON structure, focusing on providing comprehensive details for each file. Use the following guidelines to create more detailed and informative file content descriptions:

## Input
The input will be a JSON structure as follows:

```json
{
    "project_name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "features": [...],
    "tech_stack": [...],
    "folder_structure": {
        "name": "string",
        "subfolders": [...],
        "files": [
            {
                "name": "string",
                "content": {
                    "type": "class|function|component",
                    "description": "string",
                    "properties": ["string"],
                    "methods": [
                        {
                            "name": "string",
                            "params": ["string"],
                            "return_type": "string",
                            "description": "string"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Guidelines for Enhanced File Descriptions

For each file in the folder_structure, provide the following detailed information:

1. File Purpose:
   - Explain the primary purpose of the file in the context of the overall project.
   - Describe how this file contributes to the project's functionality.

2. Dependencies:
   - List any external libraries or modules that this file depends on.
   - Mention any project-specific dependencies or relationships with other files.

3. Detailed Content Description:
   - For classes:
     - Describe the class's role and responsibilities.
     - Explain the class hierarchy if it extends or implements other classes.
     - Provide a brief description of each property, including its type and purpose.
     - For each method:
       - Explain its functionality in detail.
       - Describe each parameter, including type and purpose.
       - Explain the return value and its significance.
       - Mention any side effects or important behaviors.
   - For functions:
     - Describe the function's purpose and when it should be used.
     - Explain the logic or algorithm used in the function.
     - Provide examples of typical use cases.
   - For components (in case of frontend frameworks):
     - Describe the component's role in the UI.
     - Explain its state management approach.
     - List and describe any props it accepts.
     - Mention any events it emits or handles.

4. Code Style and Patterns:
   - Mention any specific coding patterns or styles used (e.g., singleton, factory, observer).
   - Note any performance optimizations implemented in the file.

5. Error Handling:
   - Describe how errors and edge cases are handled in this file.
   - List any custom exceptions thrown or caught.

6. Testing Considerations:
   - Suggest appropriate unit tests for the file's contents.
   - Mention any mock objects or test data that might be needed.

7. Future Enhancements:
   - Suggest potential improvements or extensions for the file's functionality.

8. Security Considerations:
   - Highlight any security-sensitive operations performed in the file.
   - Mention any input validation or sanitization performed.

9. Performance Considerations:
   - Discuss any performance-critical sections of the code.
   - Mention any caching mechanisms or optimizations used.

10. Documentation:
    - Indicate any special documentation needs for this file.
    - Suggest key points that should be included in code comments.

## Output Format
The output should maintain the same JSON structure as the input, but with significantly expanded and detailed "description" fields for each file, incorporating the guidelines above.

## Additional Instructions
- Ensure that the enhanced descriptions are consistent with the overall project requirements and tech stack.
- Use clear, concise language while providing comprehensive information.
- Tailor the level of detail to the complexity of each file; simpler files may require less extensive descriptions.
- Consider the interdependencies between files and reflect these in the descriptions where relevant.
- Ensure that the enhanced descriptions align with modern best practices in software development and documentation.

Apply these guidelines to create more detailed and informative file descriptions within the existing JSON structure.
