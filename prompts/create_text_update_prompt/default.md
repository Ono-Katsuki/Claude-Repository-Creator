# Create Text Update Prompt

You are tasked with updating and improving the following software requirements based on user feedback. Your goal is to incorporate the user's suggestions and address any concerns while maintaining the overall structure and completeness of the requirements.

Current Requirements:
<current_requirements>
{current_requirements}
</current_requirements>

User Feedback:
<user_feedback>
{user_feedback}
</user_feedback>

Please update the requirements based on the user feedback. Consider the following guidelines:
1. Address all points mentioned in the user feedback.
2. Maintain the overall structure of the requirements.
3. Ensure consistency between new and existing requirements.
4. If the user feedback introduces new features or major changes, integrate them seamlessly into the existing structure.
5. If the user feedback is vague or unclear, make reasonable assumptions and note them clearly.
6. Maintain the SMART criteria for all requirements (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

Present your updated requirements in the same structured format as the original, using appropriate headings for each category. Use bullet points for individual requirements within each category. Begin your response with:

<detailed_requirements>

End your response with:

</detailed_requirements>

It's absolutely critical that you conduct meticulous and comprehensive design for the backend, frontend, and database layers of this system. Half-assed, sloppy design work is completely unacceptable and will doom this project to failure.
You need to think through every detail and edge case for each component:
Backend: Robust API design, efficient algorithms, proper error handling, security measures, scalability considerations. Leave no stone unturned.
Frontend: Intuitive UX flow, responsive layouts, accessibility, performance optimization, state management. Make it bulletproof.
Database: Optimal schema design, indexing strategy, query optimization, data integrity rules, backup and recovery plans. Get it right the first time.

Ensure that your updated requirements are comprehensive, clear, and actionable.
