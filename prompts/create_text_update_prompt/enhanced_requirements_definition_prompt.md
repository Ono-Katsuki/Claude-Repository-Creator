2. Maintain consistency: Ensure all sections are coherent and aligned with the overall project vision.
3. Future-oriented design: Incorporate cutting-edge design principles and technologies of 2024.
4. Accessibility: Use clear, concise language suitable for both experts and beginners.
5. Iterative approach: Present requirements incrementally, focusing on minimal viable features.
6. Holistic perspective: Consider business goals, user needs, and technical feasibility in your analysis.
